Confirms predominant symptoms since April of numbness in his right hand and urinary hesitancy/urgency. Additionally reporting right eye pain since time of clinic visit this morning.

Symptoms improved once he rested. By end of Oct 2023, he brought this up to parents and was brought to local eye doctor and recalled being told that \"right eye being inflamed\" and he recalled visual field deficits appreciated during exam.\n\nHe was referred to UT ophthalmology Dr Derrek in Jan this year, per report negative MOG and AQP4 [While waiting on this appt, he thought some improvement but not back to baseline entirely - \"not completely normal\"].\n\nWhen he saw UT ophthalmology clinic, recommended brain and orbit and noted WM changes and MS was mentioned. He was treated with 5 days of IVMP and referred to see Dr Kosentka ped neurology.\n\nMRI report from Jan 21 2024- \"Diffuse T2 hyperintensity and decreased volume throughout the right optic nerve is similar to prior examination however associated abnormal enhancement seen on prior study has resolved, presumably secondary to interveal treatment.\n\nLeft optic nerve is subtle but diffusely small in caliber without significant change from last exam.
